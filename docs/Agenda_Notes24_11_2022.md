## Notes by Topic


1. Discuss organizational matters:

- Communication with Sergey should be done through Mattermost (he can not always respond immediately but will do his best)
- Communicate on possibility of lab meetings during Week 5 - Resit Week - hard for some people
- **Suggestion**: trade roles on chairman and secretary - good experience for Software Project (plus SEM is prerequisite for SP)
- **Suggestion**: do not underestimate the SEM exam - do practice exams
- **Goal**: equal distribution of work between team memebers- every team member must know at least conceptually every part of codebase 
- **Suggestion**: do a Code of Conduct, helps with awareness of project and how the whole project will go moving forward - store it in GitLab repository


2. Update Sergey with outcomes of our last meeting (Mo 21-11-2022):

- Satisfation with our progress from Sergey and everybody shared experiences from their OOPP

3. Ask the questions we already have regarding the project.:

- **The project template will be published to Brightspace soon**:
      - Microservice template will have two microservices template - we should be able to extend it and create our own microservice
      - Tempate will come with CI/CD pattern we need to configure as well 
      - Group should implement sprints
      - Group should have a development branch, separate from main 
- **How elaborate should our user stories be?**:
    - They should be as concise as possible - a single user story should describe a single functionality
    - Use MoSCoW labels for them 
- **What are the deadlines we have?**
    - Next week (02-12-2022): Architecture Draft Deadline 
- **Content-Related Questions**:
    - How do we start a HOA - conflict with three years requirement?
        - make a special case - personal decision - part of assignment I - needs to be defended properly by group
        - Sergey will ask the course staff about it, but in most cases this will be a decision made by a client (e.g by us)
        - same goes for minimum number of members on board, timeline for elections, and anonymous reporting of people
    - **Final deadline for architecture**: December 16th, 2022, 18:00 - MAKE SURE PIPELINE PASSES BEFORE SUMBMITTING 
        - Pipelines take long time, up to 20 minutes 


*For next time, push the agenda to GitLab before 18:00 the day before*
