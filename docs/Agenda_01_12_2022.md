## Agenda

1. Discuss progress on project from last week [5 minutes]
2. Discuss progress made on software architecture draft [5 minutes]
3. Ask Sergey any questions about the software architecture  [15 minutes]
- Is it the case that we should not implement "Could Have Features"?
- Should we include parts of class diagrams in our architecture?
- Are there length requirements for the architecure report considering it still a draft?
4. Ask about project going forward [5 minutes]


*Durations are estimates, subject to change*

###Progress
Everyone did user stories and architecture draft. We made the code of conduct.
Gijs had Covid.
Vasko and Simeon: security, 
Erik and Gijs: 
Simeon played around with visualization.
Steve and Patrik: public notice board, requirements

###Questions
Draft is for getting started on how many microservices there are, and what they roughly do.
In architecture part: how we translated our domain into bounded contexts and microservices.
In design patterns: how we will implemented some "tricky" parts.
We should probably use a UML component diagram.
We shouldn't overcomplicate our architecture.
Implementing should have's and could have's isn't *critical*, but it would probably help us later.
WE SHOULD START CODING THIS WEEK.
Our issues and sprint management will be evaluated. GitLab management also. On Brightspace, there is a "sprint retrospective document", which we should fill out after each sprint. We can just put all docs like this into the repo.

###Feedback
Start coding!!!
For next week, we should have some code ready. (HTTP requests, etc.)
For tomorrow's submission, the file name should be: Group-HOA-18b-Assignment-1.pdf
Test coverage could be higher than 60%, 80% is more like it. (if we're shooting for a grade above a 9)
Put non-functional requirements as issues.
