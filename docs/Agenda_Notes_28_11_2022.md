## User stories

Patrik and Steve are done. Erik and Gijs still have to do them. Vasko and Simeon still need to merge their stories. Creative choices not included in the doc are nice, we should do them. We can refine the user stories on Thursday after the meeting. Each pair should recommend a weight for all stories. 

## Brightspace template to Gitlab

Simeon is doing it right now. He will push it to dev and make a merge request.

## Creative choices

We will discuss all of them on Thursday's refinement session.

## Architecture tasks

We need user stories for this first. For Thursday, beside finishing user stories, each pair should figure out suggestions for bounded contexts for their respective parts, and also UML figures for that plan.
We don't need a separate security microservice, we can use the given authentication microservice (maybe expand it).

## Code of Conduct

Vasko will typeset it in LaTeX.

## Questions for Sergey
How to tackle all levels of MoSCoW?
